# HEAP IS FAKE NEWS 

## Problem Statement 
Consumption of information on the internet can act as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it is easy to access, low cost, and can be disseminated rapidly to anyone else with access. On the other hand, for the exact same reasons, it enables the wide spread of **Fake News**! The extensive spread of fake news leads to extremely negative effects on individuals and society. Therefore, to protect our friends and families from its effects, the ability to accurately differentiate between reliable and fake news becomes an important topic. 

For the common person, discerning real from fake news comes down solely to their intuition and critical thinking, which unfortunately can be unreliable at times. What if there was a quick and reliable way to check whether a specific news source can be trusted or not. Hence, introducing **FAX or CAP**, a web application that allows users to verify news through the detection of keywords and phrases that suggests a questionable validity of the provided source.
